                    <h2 class="blogh4">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
                    <h3 class="blogh3">I love technology, and part of the reason why i wanted to get into programming in the first place is to be able to contribute
                                        to the tech industry by building cool programs that will help people to live better lives. Getting to where i'd like to be will take a lot
                                        of long-term determination and goal setting, but i can see myself in the future mainly working for myself and building my own projects, and
                                        hopefully finding a more steady job at a company that i really like to help me gain more experience and knowledge.

                        <h2 class="blogh4">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
                        <h3 class="blogh3">I think my biggest strength will be my creativity. I consider myself more of a creative type than an analytical type, and while that might seem
                                        like the complete opposite mentality to somebody who "should" like programming, i am really attracted to finding creative solutions to problems and 
                                        thinking outside of the box. I think my biggest limitation will be overcoming my limiting beliefs and habits. I intend to approach these issues with a growth
                                        mindset, but i need to be aware of my tendency to become disheartened when things become frutrating or confusing, and i also need to be aware of my tendency to
                                        overlook the importance of time management.

                            <h2 class="blogh4">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
                            <h3 class="blogh3"> I think my biggest non technical challenege will be communication. I sometimes find that i am not always the clearest when expressing my ideas, opinions or 
                                                concerns. It's always good to have a clear line of communication between yourself and your coworkers, that way everybody is on the same page and it makes working 
                                                together much easier. I have struggled in the past with communicating how i am feeling, or any concerns i may have about the project i am working on. So i will make an 
                                                effort to speak clearly and openly with my cohort and course facilitators about my progress, frustrations and sucesses.

                                <h2 class="blogh4">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
                                <h3 class="blogh3">I think being around a new group of people can be a bit daunting at times, because you never really kow what everybody thinks of you, or if those thoughts are negative or positive
                                                    i'd like to develop better conversational skills, and listening skills. I think these are key to developing good relationships with people, and everybody appreciates being listened to
                                                    and spoken to well. I think listening is one of the most important skills people can learn, and i've really enjoyed the conscious listening exercises we've done during foundations.. so i hopefully
                                                    to develop this skill further in bootcamp.

                                    <h3 class="blogh3"> I expect to work hard. And i expect to be a good team player. I really want to see myself growing at a rapid pace during bootcamp, and i know i am capable of achieving these goals.
                                                        But, like anybody, i have my weaknesses.. and so i'd really like to see myself overcome these to be able to meet the expectations i'm setting for myself. If i can do that, and finish EDA
                                                        with confidence i will be happy.
