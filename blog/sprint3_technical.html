                    <h2 class="blogh4">HTML and CSS</h2>
                    <h3 class="blogh3">A website can be written in many different languages. But the core of any website will be HTML and CSS. Html is a markup language, which means it is used to “mark up” what information is going to be presented on the page, and what the basic structure will be. By adding CSS we can style and arrange the information to make it more appealing and user friendly.</h3>

                        <h2 class="blogh4">Control Flow and Loops</h2>
                        <h3 class="blogh3">Javascript is a programming language that executes from the top down. The control flow is essentially just the order of execution, or which code is executed first, second, third, etc… It is important to understand how control flow is working in your code, otherwise the code will not run as intended. </h3>
                        <hr>
                        <h3 class="blogh3">You can think of this as being similar to baking a cake where each step must be followed. You must first preheat the oven, then mix the dry ingredients, and maybe then you may need to prepare the wet ingredients in their own bowl, then you would cook the mixture, and apply frosting or icing to the top. If you were to do these steps out of order it would be very difficult to come to a final outcome that is as yummy as if you were to follow the directions step by step. Imagine putting the dry ingredients, wet ingredients and icing into a bowl. Placing it in the oven, and then preheating the oven. Taking the mixture and waiting for the oven timer to go off. It would not work.
                        </h3>
                        <hr>
                        <h3 class="blogh3">Looping is when there is a particular piece of code that needs to be repeated until a certain condition is met. This is useful when you have a piece of code that needs to be repeated multiple times, but it would be wasteful to write out the code again and again and again.
                        </h3>
                        <hr>
                        <h3 class="blogh3">Looping can be compared to swimming in a swimming pool. When you are swimming you must complete a single action over and over, this is called a stroke. When you repeat the stroke over and over you will find that your body moves through the water. But because the swimming pool ends, you must also have a strategy for stopping your body from moving. So after completing the strokes, you might notice the flags above the lane that indicate the lane is coming to an end. You can then stop, or (break) the loop and slow your body to a stop.

                            <h2 class="blogh4">The DOM</h2>
                            <h3 class="blogh3">The DOM, or Document Object Model, is a programming interface that allows javascript to reach into the HTMl and CSS to manipulate its structure, style and content. It does this by breaking down the content of the document into a tree structure, where each element of the document is represented as a node. The visual representation of the DOM is similar to a family tree, where there is a parent and child for each part of the document. By structuring the document this way, the DOM is able to be easily traversed in order to pull out and reference content or styles when needed.

                                <h2 class="blogh4">Arrays vs Objects</h2>
                                <h3 class="blogh3">Arrays and Objects are very similar, they are both a way of containing data.
                                    Arrays are stored within a variable, and are used to store a list of values. These values can be Numbers, Strings and or Booleans and can be used by a function to call these values when needed. They are used to store large amounts of information for later use.</h3>
                                <hr>
                                <h3 class="blogh3">An Array is like a lunchbox, it can contain many different foods. It can contain, oranges, steak, pasta, sandwiches, muesli bars… anything you can imagine, but it is after all a lunch box, so it’s use is to store food.</h3>
                                <hr>
                                <h3 class="blogh3">Objects are a container that enclose data and behaviour together. They have properties applied to them, but also methods, or functions, which describe what the object can do. So, much like an Array they can store multiples pieces of information, but the benefit of an object is the ability to add functionality to these objects by specifying what the objects can do.</h3>
                                <hr>
                                <h3 class="blogh3">An object is like an object in real life. Objects in real life have physical properties, like height, width, colour, specific markings or indentations, maybe even buttons or knobs… But the key aspect of an object is that is DOES something. For example, a wind up Hot Wheels car has colours, text, physical characteristics. But it also has the functionality of winding up and releasing so that the car can move.</h3>

                                    <h2 class="blogh4">Functions</h2>
                                    <h3 class="blogh3">Functions are the part of JavaScript that gives the code functionality (if that wasn’t clear by the name). Functions are executed when they are called by the script, this can occur in different ways. You can call a function on and event, or automatically.</h3>
                                    <hr>
                                    <h3 class="blogh3">Functions are like tricks that you might teach your pet. You might train them to sit, stay, play dead, roll over, speak or shake hands. In order to do this you have to describe to the animal what it is you want them to do, this is normally done by showing them or guiding them to the final outcome. And then, when you want to impress your friends by showing off your pets new trick, you can call the “function” by speaking the command word “sit” or “stay” etc… and the function of the command word will be executed.</h3>
