                <h1>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h1>
                <p>My long term "goal" in life is to become financially free, to a point where i don't have to worry about money, but not
                    so that i am living an overly lavish lifestyle. I'd just like the time to be able to do the things i enjoy, and in order to do that
                    you need money, or you need to develop a desire to only do nothing for the rest of your life no matter what others think of you... 

                    As for the <em>thing</em> i'd like to <em>do</em> with my time... I'd like to be an artist of some kind, and so currently I am spending my time 
                    looking at all the modern tools i can use to fulfil this desire... coding being one of them.
