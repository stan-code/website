                    <h3 class="blogh3"> Emotional intelligence, often called EQ or The Emotional Quotient, is the ability to understand, regulate, investigate and manage our emotions. This differs from IQ, which is a score derived from a series of tests that are designed to test cognitive intelligence.</h3>

                        <h3 class="blogh3"> It is important to develop mastery over our emotions. The reason goes beyond what many people may assume which is that mastery over your emotions will make you feel better. Of course it will make you feel better, but the purpose of developing your EQ is not to feel better, but to get better at feeling. As we develop our ability to feel, we become more aware of how emotions trigger reactions in us that in turn guide us towards wrong action. 
                            Becoming aware of these triggering events is the first step in being able to <em>respond</em> instead of <em>react</em>.
