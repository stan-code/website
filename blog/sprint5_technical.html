                    <h2 class="blogh4">What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
                    <h3 class="blogh3">First, I have learned that i can stay fairly neutral in difficult situations, althoguh i still get frustrated. Second, I learned the my ego tends to get a bit hurt when
                        i'm comparing myself to others. This sounds like a fairly obvious thing, but during the foundations i realised how much i do this and how detrimental it is to my own success. Third, i realised that it 
                    is much easier to accomplish things when you release limiting mindsets, a lot of the time a big obstacle only seems impossible to climb over because you believe you can't do it. I had this experience a few times during foundations, but 
                every time i eventually realised that the obstacles are only impossible to overcome if i let them be impossible. </h3>

                        <h2 class="blogh4">What are the roles of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
                        <h3 class="blogh3">It's important to have good values in any area of life, but i've noticed over the foundations journey that having strong values 
                            and setting standards for yourself helps you to learn and grow. Values are kind of like little software programs we run in the operating system of
                            our personality.. They can be very effective to help battle viruses of the mind. Empathy, in relation to programming is something that i expect to 
                            encounter further as we go into bootcamp, but so far i have found that programming requires a good deal of empathy and understanding, especially when
                            working in a team. This is because programming is all about communication, and if you are not communicating openly and freely then you run into
                            "fatal errors" in your relationships with your co-workers/ co-programmers. Self awareness is also highly important, and ties into the first two quite nicely,
                            because you need self awareness to keep yourself in check about your values. And you need self awarness to know when you are being, or not being suffieiciently empathetic
                            to others. Self awareness helps you to see the "bugs" in your "code", literally and metaphorically. Without being self aware you are likely to to miss 
                            every opportunity to grow and progress and improve.

                            <h2 class="blogh4">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
                            <h3 class="blogh3">At first i was surprised that Dev Academy focused a lot on learning human skills. it's just not the kind of
                                thing you expect from a programming course. But having said that, this didn't cause me to think negatively of EDA, i instead 
                                found it really interesting and was excited to get into it. On of my interests and things i like to do in my spare time is
                                looking at self help material. It might sound a bit weird to some people, but I find self inquiry and awareness to be extremely
                                useful, because it allows you to see the negative aspects of yourself that you didn't know were there, and change them.
                                I think we're kind of taught to supress a lot of these aspects of self, and that seems to be what causes so many problems later in life.
                                And as i started to get further into the sprints, i started to realise that
                                programming and self development have a lot in common, and that there seems to be a clear paralell between the two.

                                <h2 class="blogh4">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
                                <h3 class="blogh3">Definatley the self directed learning aspect. I felt like all of the material was easy to follow and clear enough that it was pretty enjoyable to sit down and
                                                    work through it. I had a lot of fun once i got stuck into a challenge. The main problem i came up against however was myself. I always found it easy once i sat down at
                                                    the computer and started coding, but it was actually getting myself to sit down that was the hard part, with so many distractions around. This part of the learning helped me to
                                                    see aspects of myself that i was unconscious of at first, and i started to get a good understanding of the phrase "The way you do one thing is the way you do anything". I can see much
                                                    more clearly now where my strengths are, but also my weak spots. And, i found it quite challneging at first to admit my weak spots.

                                    <h2 class="blogh4">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
                                    <h3 class="blogh3">Working in any job is hard, and i think that any work environment, or learning establishment should teach the core skills. But when it comes to programming
                                                        it seems like the core skills serve an important purpose, because they help you to train your mind to view problems in a helpful way. Since programming is mostly about 
                                                        problem solving, it would be counter intuitive to meltdown, and become frustrated when faced with a difficult problem.. of course we are all human, and this can happen, but 
                                                        the core learning gives us the ability to see these problems as obstacles that we can overcome, not be overhwlmed by.

                                        <h3 class="blogh3">I don't think it was a waste of time at all. There were plenty of times during the sprints where i felt overwhelming emotion, and it really helped to be able to come back into my <body>
                                                            and not react negatively to the emotion. Being aware of myself was extremely helpful to me during the process, and i think that i would have found it a lot more difficult without that self
                                                            awareness. It's also good to learn these skills in general, and since they are relevant to this particular industry, it's better we learn them now than later.
