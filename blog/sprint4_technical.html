                    <h3 class="blogh3">A time when I got blocked on a simple problem was during the reflections for sprint 4. In the file there was a question that asked us to write a function that would add two numbers together. I was completely stumped for a while about how to achieve the right outcome and tried a few overly complicated solutions. When you write a function you can insert little bits of text, or numbers into the function. I had completely forgotten that I could use these to reference back to the original function. And I realised that I had spent much more time trying to figure out how to get the code to work, when all I needed to do was include these two little bits of text so that the second function knew which part of the first function I was referring to.</h3>

                        <h2 class="blogh4">Tell your Non Technical friend about a time you solved a problem in an elegant way</h2>
                        <h3 class="blogh3">I wouldn't say it was "elegant", but there was a time during this sprint where we had to write a piece of code that would output the average of grades in a gradebook. This part of the sprint definately made me feel like a real programmer, because i found that all the little bits and pieces of my previous learning became instantly relevant and clear. The problem required me to find the averages of the students grades inside the scorebook, it initially made me feel pretty stumped because i felt that i hadn't learned enough to be able to figure this out. So i decided to use the problem solving techniques to type out what the final outcome i needed was going to look like and work backwards from there, i also ended up watching a few youtube videos of people who were trying to solve a similar problem and i ended up using a few of these videos to do some practice runs of the problem.  The main thing i learned from the experience was how to reference variables to use in multiple functions. This helped me to become more confident in writing functions because i developed a better understnading of how they work together. I also found that i started to understand the flow of javascript a lot better which i began to develop a mental metaphor for. This exercise helped me to see that the javascript flow is similar to a rube-goldberg machine. (i still need to figure out a good way to articulate this lol, right now it is just abstract thought in my mind)</h3>

                            <h3 class="blogh3">I am feeling more and more confident in the problem solving techniques. There were times during this sprint that i didn't use them and became quite stumped and frustrated. It was good to have that experience in contrast, because when i finally did use some common sense and actually apply the problem solving techniques i found it much easier to understand the problems.</h3>

It was helpful for figuring out what didn't work, although sometimes i would find that i had the right answer the first time with just a minor error, and that would throw me off a little and cause me to go in the complete opposite direction.</h3>
